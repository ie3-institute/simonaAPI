There are currently no snapshot releases.

## Important changes

With the release of version `0.6.0` there were major changes in the way external simulations are
set up. Therefore, older simulations no longer work with the version `0.6.0`.

With the release of version `0.10.0` there was a lot of refactoring, which breaks compatibility with older simulations.

Additional breaking changes in version `0.11.0`
